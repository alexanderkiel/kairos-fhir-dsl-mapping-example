German Corona Consensus (GECCO) FHIR Mapping
============================================

This project aims to provide a mapping from CXX ressources to the GECCO dataset. Profile definitions can be
reviewed [here](https://simplifier.net/forschungsnetzcovid-19).
The mappings shown in this project are working examples. In order to use them in your CXX instance, they have to be adjusted (e.g. changing
Labor-Finding CODES to match the ones from the exporting CXX instance).
