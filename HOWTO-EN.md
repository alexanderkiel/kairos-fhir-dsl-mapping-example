#CentraXX FHIR Custom Export
## Introduction
### Scope of the document

This documentation of the CentraXX-FHIR-Custom-Export includes the following points:

* Initial setup of the interface for the CentraXX-FHIR custom export
* Configuration of the export for specific FHIR projects
* Set up a development environment and install Groovy-based Kairos FHIR DSL library
* Exemplary introduction to the function of DSL as a basis for developing your own transformation scripts.

As an introduction to the use of DSL, code examples from existing example transformation scripts are used. The specificities of the Groovy programming language are discussed contextually.

This documentation is not intended to explain the basics of Groovy and the principles of the implementation of DSL or to introduce the HL7-FHIR standard. Further links on the topics just mentioned are referenced at the appropriate point. Furthermore, this document does not contain any detailed documentation of the Kairos-FHIR-DSL itself.

A functioning CentraXX instance is required. The basic installation of CentraXX is also not part of this documentation.
